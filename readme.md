# LaceMate Website

Website I built as part of an Imperial Horizons course entitled 'Making and Prototyping for Research and Product Development'. As a group, we designed and built a product aimed at people with neuromuscular diseases or back injuries which tightens shoes with no need for using fine motor skills or bending down. I built this website to market our brand as part of this project.
